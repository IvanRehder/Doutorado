abstract={Contesting Paul Scharre’s influential vision of “centaur warfighting” and the idea that autonomous weapon systems will replace human warfighters, this article proposes that the manned-unmanned teams of the future are more likely to be minotaurs, teams of humans under the control, supervision, or command of artificial intelligence. It examines the likely composition of the future force and prompts a necessary conversation about the ethical issues raised by minotaur warfighting. © 2023 Robert J. Sparrow and Adam Henschke.},

abstract={The ability of multiple manned and unmanned aircraft systems to cooperatively engage and disable an aerial threat plays a decisive role in modern warfare scenarios. In this paper, we apply key methods to enable the so-called cooperative threat engagement capability among multiple networked agents, e.g., a swarm of drones, with combat and communication capabilities. In particular, this research combines AI-based decision-making and control techniques for a swarm of loyal wingman drones to coordinate efficient defense actions in a cooperative and autonomous manner. We apply these concepts in a defense scenario that is modeled to analyze the loyal wingman concept, which we consider an interesting testbed for cooperative decision-making and low-level control techniques. The investigated methods were implemented in a realistic 3D UAV simulator for demonstration and evaluation. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Since the intelligent manned-unmanned combined combat system will become a core asset of the future weapon system, we started policy research on its development and utilization this year. As part of the research in July, the DnA(Defense & AI) Forum was held with over 80 people from governments, armed forces, weapon manufacturers, universities, and research institutes responsible for developing future weapons systems. When manned systems such as Ground Control Stations, warships, helicopters, and fighters try to collaborate with unmanned systems such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Unmanned Ground Vehicles, and Unmanned Surface Vehicles, there are many challenges to be addressed in the future. The U.S. Department of Defense announced that interoperability, autonomy, secure networks, and human-machine collaboration are the most critical technologies enabling the use of unmanned vehicles. As these technologies develop at the same time, more and more intelligent unmanned weapon systems will be created. However, due to the different rates of technological maturation, gradual development is expected by dividing it into a simple mission system that can be remotely controlled, a low-cost portable unmanned system, an unmanned system that expands the operational range, and an unmanned system that protects the manned system. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning will have a significant impact on the application of drones and the integration of universal/unmanned traffic management (UTM) that relate to unmanned operations in urban environments at very low-level airspace. Artificial intelligence will necessitate high levels of automation and act as an enabler with respect to the integration of unmanned and manned aviation and will ultimately enable safe operations with respect to high numbers of drones utilising the same airspace, and more specifically with respect to detect and avoid capability. AI is going to be heavily developed and utilised by organisations that certify as U-space service providers (USSP's) when providing a service to Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Operators. The equipment utilised by UAS Operators will to some extent already benefit from AI, but the level of automation is currently constrained by regulation. A legal framework must exist, as AI will not only have a significant impact upon existing laws but will ensure a framework that facilitates safety and the fundamental rights of citizens and businesses with respect to AI. The EU has published a proposed law, namely the Artificial Intelligence Act as permitted under Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={In this article, we present a new concept that allows multiple human users to cooperatively and simultaneously create a mission plan for multiple unmanned systems equally available to all users assisted by a cognitive agent. With this, we aim to reduce both the workload of individual users and the error rate in mission planning. In addition, we expect an increase in battlefield awareness and improved coordination during mission execution. In military air operations, which are currently exclusively manned, there is a strict separation between the specific mission-related tasks allocated to each team. In a Manned-Unmanned-Teaming (MUM-T) environment, some manned assets are replaced by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In these setups, one of the tasks of the human user is to plan and monitor the mission. In this context our approach uses a cognitive agent that acts as a centralized planning instance. All tasks that the human users want the UAVs to perform are delegated to the agent, which schedules the individual tasks in a feasible order. It must also merge and deconflict the various plans created by individual pilots into an executable joint mission plan. In addition, the agent creates its own logical plan with the mission flow and can use it to suggest plan changes to human users or execute them directly itself. We have finalized the concept containing the corresponding workflows, procedures, deconflicting, and logical planning capabilities of the central agent. We demonstrate the implementation of the concept using our fully functional MUM-T fighter simulator. Currently, the implementation includes the agent's capabilities to (1) allow multiple pilots to simultaneously delegate tasks for the same available UAVs, (2) detect conflicts that arise during mission plan generation, (3) assist pilots in conflict resolution, (4) associated visualizations, and (5) create a logical plan that will be used to check if the mission plan meets the conditions to achieve the main objective. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

abstract={Fighter pilots may become commanders in the air in the future. Modern jet fighter aircraft have different capabilities to command the field by using various equipment. Additionally, manned and unmanned teams can be composed to increase air dominance since the human capacity is limited for long flight times for missions. When this happens, the pilots can command their unmanned wing-mans during the mission. To reach these kinds of scenarios, more tasks need to be realized autonomously to dominate the airfield with the hybrid unmanned fleet. Air combat is one of the most important and challenging tasks for fighter pilots. Due to the complexity of the problem, most of the time the air combat missions need to be realized by human pilots due to the lack of unmanned aircraft's capability. Increasing the autonomy level for this specific problem may be beneficial for armies. Therefore, the air combat mission is mostly studied for many years to solve the problem from several approaches, either pilot assistance systems or fully autonomous missions. Additionally, strong improvements in both computer technology and artificial intelligence have been experienced. The number of problems that have been solved by using artificial networks is also increasing. It is thought that similar approaches can be used to solve an autonomous air combat problem. This article aims to develop an agent that will preserve the specific energy of the aircraft while being successful in air combat missions using artificial intelligence methods. Three different agents with different reinforcement learning-based algorithms (DDPG, SAC, and PPO) are studied for the task. The agents have trained to succeed in the air combat mission in custom-generated simulation infrastructure. The novel training process is explained in detail. The performances of the agents have been assessed with the simulations performed in different scenarios. The results have shown the effectiveness of the algorithms. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Man-unmanned concepts, such as loyal wingman, have the potential to be important force-multiplications. However, man-unmanned teaming may require changes to command and control (C2) in general (e.g. the control with unmanned entities in the context of joint operations) and more detailed TTPs for AirC2 (such as procedures for the interaction between fighter pilots and unmanned entities). Two of the challenges is to achieve 1) trusted delegation to unmanned entities and 2) coordinated action among man and unmanned entities. This paper aim to establish a sound concept development trajectory. The trajectory will consist of oscillating between conceptual development, and empirical investigations feeding back to the conceptual development. We draw on the extant research on man-unmanned problems in cybernetics, human factors (human-in-the-loop) and organization science. Using these lines of inquiry, we develop models for describing and analyzing the man-unmanned problem in general, in order to: 1) Understand man-unmanned teaming in the context of a proposed Norwegian loyal wingman concept (e.g. mixed-initiative, coactive design) 2) Understand loyal wingman in a wider context of C2. (e.g. system-dynamic perspectives) 3) Paying attention to and discussing 1 and 2 in light of the breadth of potential loyal wingman configurations (e.g. along dimensions such as size, range, speed, payload, sensors, effectors, autonomy and artificial intelligence capability, in a long and short term perspective etc.) While we do not describe the specifics of 1, 2 and 3 we discuss generically the variables and principles/theories to consider with respect to 1, 2 and 3. This conceptual development will then form the basis for empirical investigations, such as aided by tabletop discussion workshops, and data collection from simulated and live environments. © 2021 IEEE},

abstract={The future of air combat is expected to evolve significantly to include new technologies and novel concepts of operation. The Manned-Unmanned Teaming concept involves low cost, attritable Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that could be deployed along with a manned aircraft. The UAVs act as a complementary asset and bolster offensive air operations. Given the complexity of future operating environments, the degree of autonomous control required for pilots to concurrently operate multiple UA Vs and their own aircraft is one area of concern. To determine the amount of autonomous control abstraction that has the largest impact in reducing operator workload and increasing system performance, a predictive workload model was developed using the Improved Performance Research Integration Tool (IMPRINT). This research concluded that maned-unmanned teams can increase mission performance and maintain the pilot's cognitive workload at a manageable level by utilizing higher levels of human control abstraction, where unmanned systems have greater degree of autonomy. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Coordinated operation of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles is being taken as an important operation mode by military and research institutions in various countries. However, the complex coordination of aircrafts in the fleet has caused great difficulties for the evaluation of mission effectiveness. This paper studies the method to evaluate the mission effectiveness of manned/ unmanned aerial team based on agent-based simulation and proposes an approach called resource consumption analyze to establish evaluation index system. This approach decomposes missions into multiple tasks, and further decomposes the process of tasks based on Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) to facilitate modeling tasks and developing evaluation indicators. Moreover, this paper builds the behavior models of combat units based on OODA and conducts several simulation experiments to evaluate the mission effectiveness of manned/unmanned aerial team. These experiments show that the evaluation approach based on OODA and agent-based simulation can help to evaluate the mission effectiveness of manned/unmanned aerial team and design more suitable aircraft for future warfare. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Up until a few years ago, the only way to get an aerial overview of a designated area was to fly over it with a manned aircraft and physically inspecting the areas or taking pictures of it. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, have been a blessing to all the industries which relied on aerial images or drawings for their work. Unmanned aerial vehicles also knows as drones, in more colloquial terms, is a blessing to all industries in the world. The cost of manufacturing and assembling drones have gone down significantly as majority of people adapted to using it. The film industries are using it to get excellent footage with accurate direction and lighting. Civilians can use it as toys. Students can use it to learn avionics and flight mechanisms. Youtubers use it for professional high resolution footage. Rescue teams use it for surveying the area. Armies use it to get a tactical advantage in a firefight and recently, Amazon is using drones for superfast delivery service. The possibilities are endless if properly invested on. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are next best thing in the field of Computer Science and that's why I plan to merge these two fields and present something which fundamentally adds more features and a hive mind facility to even work without a commanding signal. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={R apidly changing patterns in today's world impose real-time decision-making requirements in many complex organizations, ranging from maritime establishments to agile manufacturing systems and commercial enterprises. One of the key trends in maritime operations is the pervasive use of smart machines (for example, unmanned aerial and underwater vehicles) for countersmuggling, search and rescue operations, and battle management, to name a few. The primary reasons for the use of unmanned vehicles include their operability from remote locations, ultralong endurance, and high-risk mission acceptance. Additionally, these smart machines can be made smaller, agile, and more economical than their manned counterparts. With rapid advances in AI, smart machines and agents are becoming more autonomous (that is, they can both respond to human commands and operate independently) and require only intermittent human intervention to keep them aligned with human intentions. In March 2018 (Wakabayashi 2018), a pedestrian was hit and killed by a self-driving car (with an emergency driver behind the wheel), indicating the need for a human driver to intervene in a timely manner to avoid mishaps. It was later found that the emergency braking system in the car was disabled and the driver was streaming a TV show before the incident. This mishap could have been avoided had the emergency brakes been enabled and had the driver been paying attention. This incident illustrates the need to make machines more intelligent so that they can mimic the human thought processes of understanding the environment and can provide appropriate alerts for interfacing with the human when attention is warranted or required for not only unexpected but uncertain situations as well. © 2019 AI Access Foundation.

abstract={In the fighter jet domain, it is very difficult to delegate tasks to unmanned systems because such a MUM-T scenario contains tasks from different dimensions, e.g. from AI, SEAD, OCA, etc. At the same time, there is a demand for a uniform and transparent operating concept, e.g. using a tactical map. Therefore, a way is looked for to describe the many different tasks with a uniform framework. In the presented approach a task command is split into an environmental object (physical, logical) to which the instruction refers. A military action to be performed on this object and a time parameterization (slack-time). The object specification corresponds to the classification as it is usual for vectorized GIS data (point, line, area). The military action results from the different types of use (AI, SEAD, etc.) and the domains of action (Intelligence, Effect, etc.). © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This paper proposed the intelligent operational mode to support UAVs autonomous decision-making, so the pilot's cognitive load declined and the UAV's decision performance improved in manned/unmanned aerial vehicles (MAV/UAVs) teams. The intelligent operational mode, which is determined by UAVs' comprehension of the human-machine-environment system, reflects the decision preference of UAVs. To explain how the intelligent operation mode shifts, two models were created based on Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) and Fuzzy Grey Cognitive Map (FGCM). The first model assessed the pilot's cognitive load and the second derived the intelligent operational mode from the pilot's cognitive loads and many other critical factors. At the end of this paper, the rationality and feasibility of the proposed models are checked by several cases. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a robust framework for configuring and deploying a heterogeneous team of smart unmanned systems and human agents in dynamic and un-modeled environments to rapidly build mission critical situational awareness with selective details of potential areas of interest, especially focusing on minimized cognitive loading of the human agents. Five key components, namely control, communication, artificial intelligence (AI), platform, and visualization, merge seamlessly into a holistic framework to deliver this rapid situational awareness development capability to the heterogeneous manned unmanned team (MUM-T). In this framework, the overall control is seen as a combination of agent level control and mission level control. A common software, Robot Operating System (ROS), is used to establish communication, and consequently consensus, among the heterogeneous swarm of unmanned systems. These unmanned platforms are customized with co-processing hardware that can execute advanced artificial intelligence machine learning (AI/ML) modules to not only deliver stable and cooperative performance of these unmanned platforms in the swarm but also support human-centric human robot interaction (HRI). Finally, to reduce the cognitive burden on the human agents, a triaged visualization scheme, enabled through mixed reality (MR) technology, is implemented. This paper presents a preliminary proof of concept study for the presented hybrid map (i.e. 2D mapping with 3D detailing) construction framework, tested with a heterogeneous swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of varying capabilities, teamed with a human operator. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={This article describes a scalable mixed-initiative planning concept, in which a human pilot is assisted during mission (re-)planning by an artificial planning agent. The agent serves as an additional team member and enables rapid planning and re-planning of multiple vehicles. For this purpose, the agent adapts its extent of assistance based on the necessity of the given situation. The concept was implemented for the use case of manned-unmanned teaming in future military helicopter missions. Thereby, the mixed-initiative agent was implemented with three different levels of automation. The article focuses on the experimental evaluation with German military helicopter pilots. Results show the advantages of the scalable mixed-initiative concept especially in time critical and high workload situations. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

abstract={In manned/unmanned-aerial-vehicles team, the workload of manned-aerial-vehicle (MAV) pilot is an important indicator to measure pilot's cognitive state. Evaluating the pilot workload is significant to analyze human-robotics system cognition and intelligent interaction questions. This paper proposed a mathematical model that can measure pilot workload. The model evaluates the workload through three factors: pilot utilization factor, unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) request rate and the number of human-robotics interaction. Finally we simulated the model at five different levels of autonomy(LOA), proving the rationality of the model. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Recent advancements in robotics have established standard control and planning algorithms for robot localization, navigation, and manipulation, which extend the automation from skill-based to rule-based. Such automation approaches, however, are susceptible to environmental dynamics and the burden of corresponding event handling falls on the human operator. In multi-agent systems, any deviation from the otherwise inefficient one operator to one robot mapping can result in an exponential growth of system complexity, and, in the absence of some form of artificial intelligence supervisory control, the overall framework can quickly become unmanageable, counterproductive, and even hazardous. Therefore, for future mannedunmanned teaming, a knowledge-based cooperative control architecture is warranted that can process cognitive reasoning at the meta-level to autonomously carry out some or all tactical parts of the mission while maintaining constant connection with the human operator. Furthermore, in such a scenario, the human operator needs to be able to communicate with multiple robotic agents via natural language and gesture interface so that he/she can efficiently manage not just one robot but the entire swarm or at least a segment. This paper will discuss a hybrid swarm autonomy architecture to coordinate a diverse team of robots using an immersive and intuitive interface technology for cooperative control of unmanned platforms. This novel interactive interface will offer situational awareness and decision presentation capabilities. Implemented through a real time, networked, mixed reality environment, it will be designed to support rapid exploration and evaluation with the swarm as well as dynamic interaction among different human operators. One of the major objectives of this research is to reduce cognitive load on operators and enable trust among robots and humans. This paper will discuss the approach to design and evaluate a distributed trust control algorithm for high-throughput hybrid swarm autonomy, and implement it through a curated, controlled-access portal to integrate swarm algorithms and collective behavior. Major discussion points will include: customization of unmanned platforms for distributed control and sensor fusion, development and implementation of a mixed reality human robot interface portal, and incorporation of a neuro-cognitive dynamic trust controller for swarm autonomy. It is envisioned that through such interconnection between humans and robots the effectiveness of the swarm can be boosted to carry out the missions with unprecedented speed and accuracy at a fraction of the cost for complex systems. This paper presents experimental validation to the analytical models involving real and virtual platforms. Copyright © 2017 ASME.},

abstract={One of the research fields at the Institute of Flight Systems (IFS) of the University of the Armed Forces (UniBwM) focuses on the integration of reconnaissance sensor operation support in manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) helicopter missions. The purposive deployment of mission sensors carried by a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV) in such missions is expected to bring in new and impactful aspects, especially in workload-intensive situations. Paradigms of variable automation in the sensor domain and cognitive assistant systems are intended to achieve an operationally manageable solution. This paper provides an overview of the sensor assistant system to be deployed in a MUM-T setup. To manage sensor deployment automation functions, a machine decision making process represented by an agent system will be described. Depending on a workload state input, a suitable level of automation will be chosen from a predefined set. A prototype system of such agent with its capability to react on varied stimuli will be demonstrated in a reduced toy problem setup. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

abstract={In order to exert the autonomy of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle's(UAV) decision-making, based on fuzzy cognitive map (FCM), UAV's autonomous decision-making model is established. However, when UAV cannot make certain decision because of self-limiting, Manned Aerial Vehicle(MAV) will make intervention. Thus this paper designs three levels of limited intervention collaborative decision-making mechanism. By adding auxiliary decision information or adjusting decision threshold, MAV can help UAV make a new decision. This type of decision-making mechanism not only plays full use of UAV's autonomy, but also reduces MAV's control burden, decreases the frequent communication in decision-making process, which is very suitable for increasingly complex battlefield environment. Simulation indicates that limited intervention collaborative decision-making of MAV/UAV team is reasonable and feasible. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Wild fires have significant impact on atmosphere and lives. The demand of predicting exact fire area in forest may help fire management team by using drone as a robot. These are flexible, inexpensive and elevated-motion remote sensing systems that use drones as platforms are important for substantial data gaps and supplementing the capabilities of manned aircraft and satellite remote sensing systems. In addition, powerful computational tools are essential for predicting certain burned area in the duration of a forest fire. The reason of this study is to built up a smart system based on semantic neural networking for the forecast of burned areas. The usage of virtual reality simulator is used to support the instruction process of fire fighters and all users for saving of surrounded wild lives by using a naive method Semantic Neural Network System (SNNS). Semantics are valuable initially to have a enhanced representation of the burned area prediction and better alteration of simulation situation to the users. In meticulous, consequences obtained with geometric semantic neural networking is extensively superior to other methods. This learning suggests that deeper investigation of neural networking in the field of forest fires prediction could be productive. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In view of complex battlefield environment and technological factors, unmanned aerial vehicle's (UAV) decision-making cannot accurately reflect battlefield situation and make reasonable decisions by itself. To solve this problem, this paper presents a limited intervention collaborative decision-making mechanism between manned aerial vehicle(MAV) and UAV based on visualising fuzzy cognitive map (VFCM). By use of limited intervention trigger strategy, high efficiency and feasibility of decision-making can be ensured. Simulation indicates that limited intervention collaborative decision making of the MAV/UAV team is reasonable and feasible. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The coordination of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to carry out aerial surveys is a major challenge for emergency responders. In particular, UAVs have to fly over kilometre-scale areas while trying to discover casualties as quickly as possible. To aid in this process, it is desirable to exploit the increasing availability of data about a disaster from sources such as crowd reports, satellite remote sensing, or manned reconnaissance. In particular, such information can be a valuable resource to drive the planning of UAV flight paths over a space in order to discover people who are in danger. However challenges of computational tractability remain when planning over the very large action spaces that result. To overcome these, we introduce the survivor discovery problem and present as our solution, the first example of a continuous factored coordinated Monte Carlo tree search algorithm. Our evaluation against state of the art benchmarks show that our algorithm, Co-CMCTS, is able to localise more casualties faster than standard approaches by 7% or more on simulations with real-world data. © 2016 The Authors and IOS Press.},

abstract={Control of the air in envisioned large-scale battles against near-peer adversaries will require revolutionary new approaches to airborne mission management, where decision authority and platform autonomy are dynamically delegated and functional roles and combat capabilities are assigned across multiple distributed tiers of platforms and human operators. System capabilities range from traditional airborne battle managers, to manned tactical aviators, to autonomous unmanned aerial systems. Due to the overwhelming complexity, human operators will require the assistance of advanced autonomy decision aids with new mechanisms for operator supervision and management of teams of manned and unmanned systems. In this paper we describe a conceptual distributed mission management approach that employs novel human-automation teaming constructs to address the complexity of envisioned operations in highly contested environments. We then discuss a cognitive engineering approach to designing role- and task-tailored human machine interfaces between humans and the autonomous systems. We conclude with a discussion of multi-level evaluation approaches for experimentation. Copyright © 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

This paper describes the sparse supervisory control that must be exercised over teams of highly autonomous units, and considers what it means for a commander to supervise autonomous un-manned systems (AUS) that employ machine learning and cooperative autonomy. Commanders must decide whether to trust behaviors they have never seen before, and developing that trust may require several strategies. This paper describes some possible strategies in an effort to explain the challenges that must be solved. © 2013, Association for the Advancement of artificial intelligence.},

abstract={This article describes a concept for a single-seat fighter cockpit based system, simultaneously managing up to three unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAV) during mission execution. The concept is primarily based on the theory of cooperative and cognitive automation, developed at the Institute of Flight Systems at the University of the Bundeswehr Munich (UBM). Its main component is a modular assistant system, which consists of one artificial cognitive unit (ACU) per UCAV, a self-explanation capability module (SECM) and a team coordination module (TCM). The ACUs grant the unmanned team members capabilities for cooperative and rational behavior in the mission context. In order to support the manned-unmanned collaboration the assistant system is equipped with a SECM and TCM. The SECM explains the observable behavior of the unmanned platforms to the human pilot. It also aims at increasing the pilot's trust in the unmanned systems. The TCM is responsible for all aspects of team coordination, especially between manned and unmanned tasks. The presented concept is implemented in a highly realistic mission simulation environment including a generic fighter simulator, equipped with conventional avionic systems. The article concludes with first experimental results obtained in a test campaign in collaboration with the German Air Force.},

The presented concept bases on the theory of cognitive and cooperative automation and suggests that unmanned aircraft are equipped with on-board artificial cognitive units (ACUs). By this, unmanned platforms are enabled to exhibit cooperative capabilities and rational behavior in the context of the mission. To accomplish efficient manned-unmanned cooperation the concept additionally proposes to support the pilot with an assistant system module for team coordination tasks and to provide a self-explanation capability to the unmanned aircraft. This concept has been realized as laboratory prototype and already been tested with operational personnel in our human-in-the-loop full scenario simulation environment. For the further evaluation of the concept an experimental design has been worked out. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The Universität der Bundeswehr München is conducting research in the field of Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T). In the MUM-T scenario there is a human multi-UAV (Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle) operator who is responsible for the online air mission planning and re-planning. This operator shall be supported in his work by an assisting automation in order to maximize system performance. We therefore examine multiple scientific approaches to human-automation integration and present our established Cognitive and Cooperative Automation approach as well as a novel Cognitive Skill Merging approach. The latter is based upon bringing together human and machine cognitive skills in order to cooperatively reason about and work upon the common overall mission planning task without decomposing it in advance. The combination of these approaches results in the proposal of applying mixed-initiative planning to address the above-mentioned problem. The concept of the MUM-T Mission Planner is presented and future experiments are outlined. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The key elements for achieving the workload reduction necessary to facilitate such missions are threefold: first, high-level human-UAV interaction based on tasks (supervisory control), second, the delegation of helicopter commander tasks to the pilot flying (modified crew coordination concept), and third, the introduction of knowledge-based assistant systems, one for each crewmember to support their individual task performance (cooperative control). We implemented the mentioned functionalities along the design guidelines of the so-called Dual-Mode Cognitive Automation approach, in which the functions that the human operator interacts with in supervisory control (mode one) and cooperative control (mode two) are realized as artificial cognitive systems. These systems make use of cognitive task understanding, human-machine mixed-initiative interaction, human operator observation, and human mental resource prediction approaches. In addition to the concepts and methods behind the functionalities mentioned, this article describes comprehensive evaluation experiments conducted in our research helicopter mission simulator and discusses the corresponding results. © 2011 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

abstract={While robotic systems and the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been funded through the Department Of Defense (DoD) and Industry for decades, it was not until recent years that the combination of these two technologies has made truly significant advances in the area of Autonomous Operation (AO) systems. Through the efforts of the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) challenges in 2004 - 2007 timeframe, the academic and industrial communities came together to overcome some significant hurdles for the development of AO ground vehicles in both the rural and desert environments (DARPA Grand Challenge 2004 - 2005) and the urban environment (DARPA Urban Challenge 2007). Although no AO vehicle succeeded in the 2004 event, the following year four systems completed the 132 mile course within the 10 hour time limit. The winner of the 2005 event (The Stanley from Stanford University) designed an autonomous (learning system) vehicle that fused five Lidars, Radar, and an Electro Optic sensor in addition to the waypoint GPS (provided by DARPA) and an internal Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) system to produce the situational awareness required to meet the challenge. The team took approximately one year "training" the perception and planning sections of the software to compensate for various types of terrain and maneuvering. It was through extensive planning, meticulous design, and thorough testing that the final goal was achieved and it will take a much greater level of effort for DoD to realize a similar capability in the air environment. In the Air domain, DoD will not have the luxury of releasing autonomous vehicles (without significant constraints) within an operationally relevant environment (like the National Air Space (NAS)) until a very high level of confidence is achieved in their ability to perform the mission while providing a level of safety commensurate with manned operation. For DoD to succeed, it is imperative that we provide the Unmanned Air System (UAS) development community the tools required to assess all of the engineering components necessary for transition of AO vehicles into the NAS and operational environments. These tools should include a model of the required environments (emulated with access to standardized hardware/software in the loop), standard set of operational test procedures (with desired metrics), and a framework through which individual components can be assessed. It is ironic that the success of AO unmanned systems will require a structured collaborative learning process within the human domain for our goals to be realized. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Today's automation is typically tied into work processes as tools actively supporting the human operator in fulfilling certain well-defined sub-tasks. The human operator is in the role of the high-end decision component determining and supervising the work process. With emergent technology highly automated work systems can be beneficial on the one hand, but automation may as well cause problems on its own. A new way of introducing automation into work systems shall be advocated by this article overcoming the classical pitfalls of automation and simultaneously taking the benefit as wanted. This shall be achieved by so-called cognitive automation, i.e. providing human-like problem-solving, decision-making and knowledge processing capabilities to machines in order to obtain goal-directed behaviour and effective operator assistance. A key feature of cognitive automation is the ability to create its own comprehensive representation of the current situation and to provide reasonable action. By additionally providing full knowledge of the prime work objectives to the automation it will be enabled to co-operate with the human operator in supervision and decision tasks, then being intelligent machine assistants for the human operator in his work place. Such assistant systems understand the work objective and will be heading for the achievement of the overall desired work result. They will understand the situation (e.g. opportunities, conflicts) and actions of team members-whether humans or assistant systems-and will pursue goals for co-operation and co-ordination (e.g. task coverage, avoidance of redundancy or team member overcharge). On the other hand, cognitive automation can be emerged towards being highly automated intelligent agents in charge of certain supportive tasks to be performed in a semi-autonomous mode. These cognitive semi-autonomous systems and the cognitive assistants shall be denoted as the two faces of dual-mode cognitive automation (Onken and Schulte, in preparation). © 2008 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

abstract={There is significant interest in the Department of Defense to design and build networks of unmanned vehicles that will have the ability of operating autonomously, which will in effect, take the human out of the loop at certain levels of tasking. While unmanned systems do not necessarily have a human in direct, manual control, humans will be necessarily involved in planning, higher-level operation, and contingency interventions (including system failures). Thus a system of command and control unmanned vehicles is still a manned system. The implementation of networks of autonomous airborne vehicles means that not only will battlefield commanders have more flexibility and options; it also means that a layer of human command and control will be needed where none previously existed. In this futuristic command and control network, the nature of human interaction will change from that of manual control to supervisory control, with different layers of automation, which will require more abstract knowledge-based reasoning. Requiring an operator to manage high value assets in a time-pressure environment through constant replanning requires substantial cognitive effort, and affects both individuals and teams in the command and control environment. This paper will discuss a prototype created to address this dynamic replanning problem through a U.S. Navy future naval capabilities research effort.},
